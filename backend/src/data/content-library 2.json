      "body": "A hangover is driven by a mix of dehydration, inflammatory signaling, low blood sugar, and sleep disruption rather than a single toxin. Acetaldehyde (the metabolite of alcohol) is irritating, and suppressed vasopressin increases urine output.\n\nKey points:\n- Immune markers (cytokines) rise the morning after drinking and contribute to headache and fatigue.\n- Vasopressin suppression and sweating/urination increase fluid and electrolyte loss.\n- Fragmented sleep and late-night light exposure worsen next-day cognition.\n\nTakeaway: Hydration, food, and time for metabolism are the core tools-there is no instant cure.",

      "body": "Oral supplements pass through the gut and liver (first-pass metabolism), while transdermal patches rely on skin permeability, which varies by molecule size and formulation. Evidence for superior transdermal delivery of most vitamins is limited.\n\nKey points:\n- Fat-soluble compounds and small molecules penetrate skin more easily than large water-soluble vitamins.\n- Oral B-vitamins have well-documented bioavailability; peer-reviewed data for transdermal B-complex is sparse.\n- Any supplement should complement-not replace-hydration, sleep, and nutrition.\n\nTakeaway: Choose forms with published absorption data; be skeptical of \"100% absorption\" marketing claims.",

      "body": "Hydration is more than just water volume; it requires electrolytes to maintain fluid balance. Moderate caffeine intake has only a mild diuretic effect for most people.\n\nKey points:\n- Alternate alcohol with water plus a small amount of sodium/potassium to offset losses.\n- Sugary drinks can worsen GI upset; look for balanced electrolyte ratios instead of high sugar loads.\n- Clear urine is not required; pale yellow is a reasonable target.\n\nTakeaway: Pair fluids with electrolytes and pacing-myths like \"coffee dehydrates you\" or \"chugging water fixes everything\" are oversimplified.",

      "body": "Alcohol metabolism uses the cofactor NAD+ to convert ethanol to acetaldehyde and acetate. NAD+ pools decline with age, and slower regeneration can make clearance feel harder in older adults.\n\nKey points:\n- Lower NAD+ availability can slow alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase steps.\n- Sleep quality and total body water also decline with age, compounding symptoms.\n- Lifestyle (nutrition, sleep, medication interactions) often matters more than any single supplement.\n\nTakeaway: Expect slower recovery with age; pacing, hydration, and lighter intake are the most reliable levers.",

Over-diluting with plain water alone can prolong recovery in some cases.\n\nKey points:\n- Oral rehydration solutions use modest sugar with sodium to improve absorption; very sugary drinks slow gastric emptying.\n- Include light snacks with potassium (fruit, potatoes) and sodium (broth) alongside fluids.\n- Avoid excessive alcohol + NSAIDs + dehydration, which can stress kidneys and GI tract.\n\nTakeaway: Balanced fluids with electrolytes outperform water-only approaches for post-drinking recovery.",
