## Status: Draft

## Story

3. **Manual Process Definition**:

## Dev Notes

### Risk Mitigation Strategies - **PRIMARY DIRECTIVE #4: DRASTICALLY SIMPLIFY**
[Source: QA Risk Assessment 1.9-risk-20251202.md]

**CRITICAL STRATEGIC PIVOT**: All automation has been removed to prevent **BUS-001 (Spammer Reputation)**.

**REMOVED**:
- ❌ `RedditContentPoster` Service
- ❌ `CommunityMetrics` Service
- ❌ `AMAScheduler` Service
- ❌ Custom Dashboard

**NEW STRATEGY**:
- **Manual First**: Humans post content. Humans reply.
- **Native Tools**: Use Reddit's built-in analytics.
- **Safety**: Zero risk of "bot behavior" bans.

### Content Library Structure
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "science-hangover-1",
      "title": "The Science of Hangovers",
      "body": "...",
      "status": "ready"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Manual Strategy
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)**: Setup & Seed. Post 3-4 articles manually from the Library.
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12)**: Engage elsewhere. Reply to comments.
3. **Phase 3**: Evaluate.
