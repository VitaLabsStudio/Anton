# Enhanced Risk Profile: Story 1.9: Reddit Community Building

**Date**: 2025-12-02  
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Status**: Updated & Finalized for Architect Review

## 1. Executive Summary

Story 1.9 aims to build a Reddit community, but the proposed technical implementation (automated content posting, automated metric tracking, automated AMA scheduling) is fundamentally at odds with the goal of building a trusted, organic community. Reddit's culture is hostile to automation.

**The primary risk is that the "tools" we build will kill the community before it starts.**

This assessment demands a **radical de-scoping** of the technical work. The "features" should be removed in favor of a manual, human-driven strategy for the first 90 days.

- **Total Risks Identified**: 4
- **Critical Risks (Score 9)**: 1 (Brand Reputation/Spam)
- **High Risks (Score 6)**: 3
- **Overall Assessment**: **NO-GO**. The technical plan must be scrapped. The story should be converted into a "Process & Content" story, removing almost all software development tasks.

## 2. Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Category | Probability (1-3) | Impact (1-3) | Score (P×I) | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **BUS-001** | **"Spammer" Label due to Automation** | Brand Reputation | 3 (High) | 3 (High) | **9** | **CRITICAL** |
| **BUS-002** | **Community "Ghost Town" Effect** | Business Strategy | 3 (High) | 2 (Medium) | **6** | **HIGH** |
| **TECH-001** | **Over-Engineering (Premature Optimization)** | Technical | 3 (High) | 2 (Medium) | **6** | **HIGH** |
| **BUS-003** | **Moderator Outreach Backfires** | Operational | 2 (Medium) | 3 (High) | **6** | **HIGH** |

## 3. Actionable Mitigation & Implementation Plan

**This section is for the Architect Agent.** The following directives require REMOVING tasks from the story, not adding them.

---

### **CRITICAL RISK: "Spammer" Label due to Automation (BUS-001)**
**Problem**: Automating content posting and cross-promotion is the fastest way to get banned on Reddit. Users and algorithms detect patterns easily. The proposed `RedditContentPoster` service is a liability.

**Mitigation & Implementation**:
1.  **DELETE Technical Tasks**: The Architect MUST delete the following tasks from the story:
    *   ❌ `Task 3: Create Reddit Content Poster Service`
    *   ❌ `Task 5: Create Community Metrics Service`
    *   ❌ `Task 6: Create Dashboard API Endpoints`
    *   ❌ `Task 7: Create AMA Scheduler`
    *   ❌ `Task 10: Write Integration Tests` (for the above services)

2.  **Pivot to Manual Strategy**: Replace the deleted tasks with a "Manual Execution Plan":
    *   **Task**: "Create Content Calendar (Notion/Doc)"
    *   **Task**: "Manual Subreddit Setup (One-time script)"
    *   **Task**: "Weekly Manual Review Process Definition"

### **HIGH RISK: Over-Engineering (TECH-001)**
**Problem**: We are building a `MetricsService` and `Dashboard` for a subreddit with 0 subscribers. This is waste.

**Mitigation & Implementation**:
1.  **Use Reddit Native Tools**: The built-in Reddit Moderator Tools provide all the metrics needed (traffic stats, growth, engagement) for the first year.
    *   **Action**: Remove `CommunityMetricsService`. Explicitly state in the story that "Native Reddit Mod Tools will be used for analytics."

### **HIGH RISK: Moderator Outreach Backfires (BUS-003)**
**Problem**: Templated, "cold call" messages to moderators often result in bans.

**Mitigation & Implementation**:
1.  **Human-Only Outreach**:
    *   **Action**: Add a constraint to the story: "Moderator outreach must be performed manually by a human account with history in the subreddit. No automated scripts or templates."

### **HIGH RISK: Community "Ghost Town" Effect (BUS-002)**
**Problem**: Launching a subreddit without content looks bad.

**Mitigation & Implementation**:
1.  **Seed Content Strategy**:
    *   **Action**: Instead of code, the primary deliverable for this story is the **Content Library** (the actual JSON/Markdown files of the articles), which will be posted MANUALLY during the launch week to make the subreddit look active immediately.

---

## 4. Final Recommendation

Story 1.9 is **NO-GO** as a software development story. It should be refactored into a **Content & Configuration** story.
*   **Keep**: Content Library creation, Subreddit Setup Script (simple).
*   **Delete**: All automated services (Poster, Metrics, Scheduler).

**Architect Directive**: Strip this story down to its bare essentials. Do not write code for problems we don't have yet.
