nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Credential validation, masked logging, and `.gitleaks.toml` prevent EAA-style tokens from being committed.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Threads traffic is funneled through the Bottleneck rate limiter so the 200 req/hour cap is never exceeded.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Axios interceptor + CircuitBreaker + health checks keep the client resilient during 401s and downtime.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Shared `IPlatformClient`, Zod validation, and documented auth/rate limiter hooks keep platform code consistent.'
