gate: PASS
status_reason: 'All ACs satisfied with manual-first delivery: 10 sourced posts in the library, one-time subreddit setup script (dry-run by default) configuring description/sidebar/rules/stylesheet, and community strategy + tracking template relying solely on native Reddit tools. No automation shipped; remaining lint noise is in unrelated legacy files.'
