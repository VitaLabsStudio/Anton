# Epic List

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure
**Goal**: Establish project structure, Docker Compose deployment, database schema, platform API authentication, and Reddit karma farming strategy. Deliverable: A deployed bot that can authenticate with Twitter, Reddit, and Threads, with comprehensive monitoring and Reddit community building capabilities.

## Epic 2: Multi-Signal Analysis & Decision Engine
**Goal**: Build the core intelligence layer that analyzes posts across four signal categories, calculates Decision Scores, detects power users, implements temporal intelligence, and monitors competitive mentions. Deliverable: Bot can analyze posts from queue, prioritize power users, optimize timing, detect competitors, select optimal archetypes, and assign modes—without posting yet.

## Epic 3: Message Generation & Engagement
**Goal**: Implement reply generation using eight archetypes (including screenshot-worthy content), platform-specific personalities, competitive defensive positioning, and actual posting capability. Deliverable: Bot generates contextually appropriate, story-worthy replies optimized per platform and posts them (initially in manual approval mode for safety).

## Epic 4: Learning Loop & Optimization
**Goal**: Build feedback collection, KPI tracking, A/B testing framework, community champions identification, autonomous learning mechanisms, and comprehensive 10-view dashboard. Deliverable: Bot monitors reply outcomes, identifies advocates, adjusts strategy weights based on performance, and surfaces insights in master dashboard.

## Epic 5: Production Hardening & Safety
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive safety protocols, monitoring, alerting, human escalation workflows, and compliance verification. Deliverable: Fully autonomous production-ready bot with 24/7 monitoring, auto-moderation, and human oversight controls.

## Epic 6: Competitive Intelligence & Market Positioning
**Goal**: Implement comprehensive competitive intelligence capabilities that monitor competitor mentions, deploy defensive positioning strategies, track market share of voice, and surface product gap insights. Deliverable: Fully integrated competitive monitoring system with automated defensive replies, market intelligence dashboard, and product strategy insights.
