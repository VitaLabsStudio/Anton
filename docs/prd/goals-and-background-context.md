# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Build an autonomous AI social media manager that operates 24/7 across Twitter/X, Threads, and Reddit to spread awareness for Vita's transdermal patches
- Deliver genuine value through educational, empathetic content that helps users in their moment of need while maintaining transparent brand affiliation
- Drive measurable commercial outcomes (CTR >2%, conversion >8%, revenue per reply >$0.50) while building a beloved, trusted brand personality (Love KPIs: thanks/likes >12%, positive sentiment >75%)
- Create modular system architecture that supports future patch products (Sleep, Energy) beyond initial hangover support focus
- Learn continuously from every interaction to optimize engagement strategies within strict safety and compliance guardrails
- Operate at minimal cost ($25-35/month DeepSeek LLM + $0 self-hosted infrastructure vs $15k-21k human-only) while achieving superior 24/7 coverage and moment-of-need responsiveness
- Gather valuable market data about Vita's transdermal patch opportunity through real-world social media interactions
- Implement maximum reach keyword filtering (200+ terms) to process 20-30k posts/week, prioritizing customer acquisition over cost savings (reaching 1,500-2,500 potential customers/week vs 800-1,200 narrow approach)
- Prioritize high-impact power users (>5k followers, verified badges) with accelerated response times (<30 min) and premium engagement strategies to maximize brand amplification
- Monitor competitive landscape (LiquidIV, Drip Drop, ZBiotics, Flyby) with defensive positioning strategies and market intelligence gathering
- Generate screenshot-worthy, story-worthy content that users naturally want to share, amplifying organic reach beyond direct engagement

## Background Context

Vita faces a classic challenger brand problem: users experiencing hangover symptoms have immediate purchase intent, but don't know Vita exists. Traditional ads reach users before or after the problem window—not during. Social platforms (Twitter, Reddit, Threads) are where users actively discuss symptoms in real-time, but branded responses are met with skepticism unless they provide genuine, non-promotional value first.

Current solutions fail: spam bots damage trust and get banned, while human-only community management ($15k-21k/month for 3 platforms) can't scale to 24/7 coverage and misses 70-80% of high-intent posts occurring outside work hours. Antone solves this as Vita's internal marketing tool by operating at machine scale with human-level contextual intelligence, delivering practical help first and product discovery second. Deployed on self-hosted infrastructure with maximum reach keyword filtering (200+ terms), Antone operates at $25-35/month (99% cost reduction vs human-only) while processing 20-30k posts/week through DeepSeek R1 LLM, prioritizing customer acquisition over marginal cost savings.
