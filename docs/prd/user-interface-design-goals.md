# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Antone's primary interface is its social media presence (@antone_vita accounts), but the internal oversight dashboard provides human operators with clear visibility into bot behavior, performance, and decision-making. The dashboard emphasizes **transparency** (why decisions were made), **control** (manual approval/override), and **insight** (KPI trends and learning progress).

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Real-time Activity Feed**: Live stream of posts being analyzed with decision scores and selected modes visible
- **One-Click Approval**: Hover over generated reply to see full context, click to approve or edit before posting
- **KPI Dashboard**: Three-column layout (Commercial | Love | Safety) with trend indicators and alert badges
- **Dive-Deep Analysis**: Click any interaction to see full Multi-Signal breakdown, relationship memory context, and outcome metrics

## Core Screens and Views (Master Dashboard)

1. **🎯 Mission Control (Homepage)**: Real-time "heartbeat" with live activity feed, 24hr KPI summary, and active alerts.
2. **🔍 Filtering Funnel Intelligence**: Visual funnel of 200+ keyword strategy (Scanned → Matched → Spam Filtered → Queued) with keyword ROI table.
3. **💰 Revenue Attribution**: Conversion funnel and revenue attribution by reply, archetype, and platform.
4. **👥 Customer Journey**: User lifecycle tracking (New/Engaged/Converted/Loyal), repeat engagement rates, and cohort retention.
5. **📊 Triple Bottom Line KPIs**: Scorecard for all 9 Commercial/Love/Safety KPIs with trend lines and targets.
6. **✍️ Content Quality Insights**: Analysis of optimal reply characteristics (length, tone, emojis) and archetype performance.
7. **🧪 A/B Testing Lab**: Management of active experiments and results archive.
8. **⚙️ System Health**: Real-time status of all components, queue depths, and DeepSeek cost tracking.
9. **🏆 Competitive Intelligence**: Share of voice tracking, competitor mention analysis, defensive positioning performance, and market intelligence insights.
10. **💎 Advocacy & Community Champions**: Community champions leaderboard, DM campaign performance, advocate impact tracking, power user engagement status, and testimonial library.

None (internal tool for Vita team members)

## Branding

Align with Vita's existing brand guidelines. Dashboard should feel professional and data-driven (healthcare/analytics aesthetic rather than consumer social media) with clean typography and emphasis on readable metrics.

## Target Device and Platforms

Web Responsive (desktop primary, tablet/mobile readable for on-the-go monitoring)
