# config/decision-thresholds.yaml
# Rationale: Based on historical data analysis (date: TBD)
# See: docs/adr/006-mode-selection-thresholds.md

thresholds:
  sssHelpful:
    0.82
    # Rationale: 82nd percentile of successful helpful engagements
    # Data source: Analysis of 10,000+ historical decisions
    # Trade-off: Higher threshold reduces false positives but may miss opportunities

  sssModerate:
    0.55
    # Rationale: Median SSS score, separates high/low intent
    # Configurable for A/B testing

  evsHighViral:
    5.0
    # Rationale: 5× baseline = statistically significant viral event
    # Based on EVS distribution analysis

  evsModerateViral:
    2.0
    # Rationale: 2× baseline = moderate engagement spike

  arsStrong:
    0.70
    # Rationale: 70th percentile of relationship scores
    # Indicates strong prior positive interactions

  minSampleSize:
    100
    # Rationale: Power analysis for 10% effect size, 80% power, α=0.05
    # Used for Bayesian shrinkage, not hard cutoff
    # See: docs/adr/007-bayesian-shrinkage.md

  confidenceThreshold:
    0.70
    # Rationale: 70% confidence threshold for flagging human review
    # Conservative: prefer human review over risky auto-decisions
